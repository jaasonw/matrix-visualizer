# matrix-visualizer

This calculator allows you to interactively perform row operations on an m x n dimensional matrix with support for symbolic math. Rather than automatically row reducing a matrix, this allows you to manually perform and visualize the effect of each individual row operation on matricies with symbolic math (CAS) support, provided by [math.js](mathjs.org/) (this means it supports variables, fractions, etc as matrix elements).

# why another matrix calculator?

Yes, I am aware there's already many matrix calculators out there (Symbolab, Wolfram, etc). This does not attempt to replace them. Instead, this attempts to fill in the gap between performing row operations on a piece of paper and automatically row reducing a matrix. Manually row reducing matrices is tedious, error prone, and may not even one to one yield the results of online calculators. The objective of this calculator is for the user to perform their own row operations to derive their own solution
